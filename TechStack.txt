Tech Stack for Stablecoin-Powered Neobank

1. Blockchain Layer
Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum One:
Ethereum Mainnet is used as the base layer for security and decentralization, enabling compatibility with DeFi protocols and token standards.
Arbitrum One serves as the scalable Layer 2 solution, providing high-speed, low-cost transactions while maintaining full EVM compatibility for Solidity-based smart contracts.
Cross-Chain Support: Integrating cross-chain bridges (e.g., LayerZero or Wormhole) for interoperability with other blockchains, such as Polygon zkEVM or Avalanche.

2. Account Abstraction
ERC-4337 Implementation:
Utilizes account abstraction to simplify wallet management by eliminating the need for users to handle private keys directly.
Smart Contract Wallets: Integrated with wallets like Gnosis Safe that support ERC-4337.
Gas Sponsorship: Paymaster contracts enable transaction cost sponsorship, enhancing user experience.
Wallet-as-a-Service:
Adopting solutions like Magic.link or Sequence Wallet to accelerate account abstraction and improve usability without custom infrastructure.

3. Tokenization Standards
Permissioned Tokens (ERC-1404):
Used for compliance, enabling transfer restrictions and seamless integration with KYC/AML processes.
Real-World Asset Tokenization:
ERC-721: For unique assets like property or invoices.
ERC-1155: For semi-fungible tokens representing fractionalized assets.
ERC-3525: For complex financial instruments such as bonds or tranche-based lending.
Metadata Storage: Securely stored off-chain via IPFS or decentralized databases, with links embedded in token contracts.

4. Payment Rails
On/Off-Ramp Integration:
Partnerships with providers like Transak, MoonPay, and LATAM-specific services like Bitso and MercadoPago.
Supports local payment methods (e.g., PIX, ACH) for fiat-to-crypto and vice versa.
Virtual Card Issuance:
Collaborations with fintechs offering crypto-to-fiat cards (e.g., VISA, Mastercard).
API integration enables seamless virtual card issuance linked to user stablecoin balances.
Dynamic Stablecoin Support:
Users can hold and transact with multiple stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI, Celo Dollars) to increase flexibility and choice.

5. Smart Contract Architecture
Modular and Upgradeable Design:
Uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s Transparent Upgradeable Proxy for flexibility while adhering to best practices for security and governance.
Savings and Lending Protocols:
ERC-4626 Tokenized Vaults: Yield-bearing vaults integrated with protocols like Aave, Compound, or Yearn Finance.
Multi-Collateral Lending Pools: Accepts ERC-20 tokens and tokenized real-world assets as collateral.
Oracles: Chainlink ensures reliable price feeds for assets and collateral valuation.
Decentralized Compliance:
Leverages standards like ERC-725/735 for decentralized identity verification, streamlining KYC/AML processes on-chain.

6. Backend Infrastructure
Backend Framework:
Built with NestJS and TypeScript for robust, scalable development.
Database:
PostgreSQL as the primary database with Prisma ORM for type-safe queries.
Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., user balances, transaction history).
API Architecture:
GraphQL APIs implemented with Apollo Server to provide flexible, efficient client-server communication.
Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka for real-time transaction updates and notifications.

7. Frontend Architecture
Web Dashboard:
Developed with Next.js for server-side rendering and fast performance.
UI Components: Built with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI for a clean, responsive design.
Mobile Applications:
Framework: Developed using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
Features:
Simplified onboarding with social logins.
Embedded wallets for a seamless crypto experience.
Localization for multiple languages, catering to LATAM users.

8. Security and Compliance
Smart Contract Security:
Engaging top-tier auditing firms like OpenZeppelin or ConsenSys Diligence for comprehensive code reviews.
Following best practices with extensive testing using frameworks like Hardhat and Chai.
Compliance Integration:
Integrating KYC/AML services like Jumio or Onfido.
Enforcing compliance through contract-level transfer restrictions and identity verification.
Fraud Detection:
AI-powered systems monitor transactions for suspicious activities, flagging anomalies in real time.

9. DevOps and Deployment
Cloud Infrastructure:
Hosted on AWS or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.
Containerization: Using Docker for consistent environments.
Orchestration: Managed with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Automated builds, testing, and deployments with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
Monitoring and Logging:
Monitoring: Implemented with Prometheus and Grafana for system health tracking.
Logging: Centralized with Datadog or the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

10. AI Integration
Risk Assessment and Credit Scoring:
Machine learning models evaluate user data and transaction histories to assess creditworthiness and personalize lending rates.
Fraud Detection:
Real-time monitoring with AI algorithms to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities.
Customer Support:
AI-powered chatbots provide instant assistance for common inquiries, reducing response times and operational costs.
Personalized User Experience:
AI analyzes user behavior to offer tailored recommendations and financial advice.
AI Infrastructure:
Frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch for developing machine learning models.
Deployment: Lightweight AI inference using ONNX Runtime or TensorFlow Serving, integrated as microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.

Summary
This stack is designed for scalability, security, and user accessibility while maintaining compliance with LATAM-specific regulatory requirements. By leveraging cutting-edge blockchain protocols, robust backend architecture, and AI-driven enhancements, this solution aims to redefine digital banking for LATAM markets.
